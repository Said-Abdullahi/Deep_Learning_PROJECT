**Deep Learning Project: Smart Recycling**

**Overview**

This repository contains a projects from my Master of Data Science degree. These assignments aims to demonstrate my learning in deep learning theory and its application to data analytics and artificial intelligence problems.

In this repo I apply best practices in deep-learning computer vision to develop a practical solution for waste classification, contributing to environmental sustainability.

**Background**

Every day, we place items in our recycle bins to reduce landfill waste. However, "wish recycling"—recycling incorrect items—can lead to contamination. Given that recycling rules vary by city council, this project aims to create a technological solution to ensure only permitted items are recycled according to local regulations. This helps prevent recycling contamination and supports proper waste management.

In these assignments we will demonstrate:

- Applying deep learning theory to design suitable deep learning solutions for the tasks.
- Critically evaluating and reflecting on the pros and cons of various design decisions.
- Demonstrating creativity and resourcefulness in providing unique individual solutions.
